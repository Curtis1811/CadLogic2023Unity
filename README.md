# CadLogic2023Unity
 
Using Unity 2022.3.32f1


When in the project, make sure to toggle on either a 2D joist or a 3D mesh to see the logic's visual representation. 

## 2dJoist

The 2d joist is represented in a 3d space but only uses 2d logic.

If you wish to test with different types of joist sizes please change the data inside of JoistPoints.Start();

## NormalsFaceDirection
Here we calculate the face direction. Creating a mesh and a blue line indicates the direction of the face direction. Unfortunately, I did not have time to add an arrow. The longest length displays the direction.
